# Local-PDF-Reader-RAG-Pipeline-with-LangChain-and-OpenAI
This project builds a RAG pipeline using LangChain to read and query local PDFs. It loads files with PyPDFLoader, splits text, creates OpenAI embeddings, stores them in ChromaDB, and retrieves relevant chunks to answer questions with ChatGPT-like responses grounded in your document.
